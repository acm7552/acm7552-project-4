                    <p>Snap.svg was my animation Javascript library of choice, along with jquery,
                        for this assignment. The original scope of this project was to use simple
                         but elegant flowing animations with simple shapes in a nautical setting. 
                         I found using snap.svg to be uniquely infuriating for several reasons.

                    <p>I quickly learned I could not retrieve the attributes of any shape as a variable, 
                        only assign to them and change them. I could not find an online resource that even informed 
                        me of what the attributes of the rectangle might be, making it even harder to figure out what I could
                        do with the shapes. Snap.svg's <a href = "http://snapsvg.io/docs/">Documentation</a> was astonishingly unhelpful.

                        <p>Javascript in HTML is awkwardly sequenced with animations; I could not 
                            do something as simple as definining a method where the boat moves to the left,
                            and then to the right. Any similar instructions just completely overwrite each other,
                            executing only the last one. In order to even have the super simple looping animations
                            in the executables, the method must recall itself recursively, and call more than one function
                            if I wish to have (god forbid) more than one step in the bland animation.
